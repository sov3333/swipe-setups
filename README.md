## How to Setup from Scratch

Frontend:
1. `mkdir client`
2. `cd client`
3. `npm create vite@latest ./` then choose React framework and JavaScript variant.
4. Install dependencies: `npm i react-router-dom`

Backend:
1. In root, type `mkdir server`
2. `cd server`
3. `npm init -y`
4. In the package.json file:
- Add to scripts: `"start": "nodemon index"`.
- Add below description: `"type": "module",` so that we can use ES6 import/exports instead of require statements.
5. Install dependencies: `npm i cors dotenv express mongoose nodemon method-override`
6. Install Chakra UI: `npm i @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/icons @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion`
